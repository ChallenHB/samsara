;; TODO: force keys to string?

;;
;; The core of the state management is done via this KeyValue store.
;; As a normal K/V store you can `set`/`get` or delete (`del`)
;; an arbitrary key. The value will stored and persisted together
;; with the output events in such way that if the process fail
;; before persisting the values, the state will be restored
;; to the value they had before processing the requests.
;; Keeping K/V state aligned with the events to process,
;; guarantee consistent values and high processing speed
;; as the processing is done entirely in memory.
;;
;; The K/V store is distributed across all processing machines.
;; The sharding strategy follows the same strategy of the events
;; processing.
;; Part of the key is the `sourceId` of the event you are processing
;; it is required. It is really important to provide the same `sourceId`
;; of the events in order to guarantee that the state is restored in
;; the same place.
;;
;; In order worlds the Distributed K/V Store will be distributed
;; in the exact same way of the events, guaranteeing that a certain
;; key will always be local to a the task which is processing a certain
;; event with the same `sourceId`.
;;

;;
;; This protocol contains the function to manage the state
;; from a pipeline user perspective. The KeyValue store
;; can be backed by several different implementations
;; depending on the runtime configuration.
